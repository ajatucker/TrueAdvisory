True Advisory is a one-stop shop for tutoring and class discussion. 
Add your courses to your course list, and you can see the class discussion and available resources for that class. 
Users can submit updates to the page if the information is outdated, especially so students can stay up-to-date with what they need to succeed. 
There are a few problems that True Advisory seeks to solve. Currently important resources are scattered around the main UMD website. 
Depending on the major, there is often a lack of resources. Tutoring is scarce, and it can be hard to find help. 
This site seeks to be somewhat of a self-moderating ecosystem where students, admins, and tutors request or update information as needed.
