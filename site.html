        <h1>Welcome to True Advisory</h1>
        <p>True Advisory is a one-stop shop for tutoring and course discussion. Add your courses to your course list, 
            and you can see the course discussion and available resources for that course. Users can submit updates to 
            the page if the information is outdated, especially so students can stay up-to-date with what they need to 
            succeed. There are a few problems that True Advisory seeks to solve. Currently important resources are scattered 
            around the main UMD website. Depending on the major, there is often a lack of resources. Tutoring is scarce, 
            and it can be hard to find help.</p>
